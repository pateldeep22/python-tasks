'''
Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
 Expected Output:
The output should include the result of each operation performed, for example:
'''

a=int(input("Enter first number: "))
print("First no is: ", a)
b=int(input("Enter second number: "))
print("Second no is: ", b)
#Addition
ad=a+b
print("Addition of the two no's is : " , ad)
#Subtraction
sb=a-b
print("Subtraction of the two no's is : " , sb)
#Multiplication
ml=a*b
print("Multiplication of the two no's is : " , ml)
#Division
di=a//b
print("Division of the two no's is : " , di)
